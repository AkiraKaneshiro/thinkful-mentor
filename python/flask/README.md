Here are some Flask apps.

General notes to get these running:
+ They all use the same requirements.txt file, which is in the same folder
as this readme.

+ Generally, copy example-env if it exists (not all projects have one) to .env, modify it
for your system, and run 'source .env' to get the environment setup.  You can
also checkout autoenv.

+ The environment variables in .env will need to be setup as heroku config
variables for your app.
